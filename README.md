<h2>Motivation:</h2>

A lot of food is wasted on a daily basis at weddings, parties, restaurants, and hotels in India. India, being a poverty affected country, deals with tough situations to meet everyone's basic demands. India currently ranks 105 out of 117 countries, below all South-East Asian countries on global hunger and poverty index. To deal with the issue of food wastage and poverty, we aim to have these two issues juxtapose each other to become a solution.  NGOs that work in the field of feeding the needy ones. Khaan-दान-Bot is an add-on Telegram bot that assists our website. Telegram provides a large number of users to be connected, hence at pandemic times like Corona Virus, it serves as a good platform to help amidst lockdown.
